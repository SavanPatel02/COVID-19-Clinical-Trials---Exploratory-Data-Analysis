# COVID-19 Clinical Trials - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of over 5,700 COVID-19 clinical trials. The goal is to clean the data, analyze its components, and visualize key trends and patterns to better understand the global research response to the pandemic.

The analysis follows a structured 10-step process, from data loading and cleaning to advanced time-series and sponsor analysis. The final output includes a cleaned dataset ready for machine learning and a series of (16) visualizations.

## üöÄ Key Insights & Highlights

  * **Massive Research Spike:** A monumental surge in clinical trials was observed in **2020**, with **4,245** new trials registered, up from just 93 in 2019.
  * **Geographic Focus:** The **United States** leads the research efforts with 1,267 trials, followed by **France** (647) and the **United Kingdom** (306).
  * **Top Sponsors:** **Assistance Publique - H√¥pitaux de Paris** is the single largest sponsor, backing 101 trials.
  * **Trial Status:** The majority of trials are currently **'Recruiting'** (2,805 trials), indicating a massive, ongoing effort.
  * **Participant Scale:** The analysis covers trials with a total enrollment of over **105 million** participants, with an average of 18,213 participants per trial (though this is skewed by a few very large-scale studies).

## üìä Visualizations Showcase

This repository generates 16 detailed plots. Here is a sample of the key findings:

## üî¨ Analysis Workflow

The notebook is structured in a clear, step-by-step process:

1.  **Load Dataset:** Import the `COVID clinical trials.csv` file.
2.  **Initial Data Exploration:** Review data shape, `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to get a first look.
3.  **Data Types Analysis:** Separate columns into categorical and numerical features.
4.  **Missing Data Analysis:** Identify and visualize missing data percentages. Columns with \>95% missing data (`Results First Posted`, `Study Documents`) are dropped.
5.  **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**
      * Drop duplicate rows.
      * Extract a new `Country` feature from the `Locations` column.
      * Fill missing values for categorical features (like `Phases`, `Acronym`) with placeholders.
      * Impute missing `Enrollment` values with the median.
6.  **Univariate Analysis:** Analyze single variables to understand their distributions (e.g., Trial Status, Phases, Gender, Study Type, Enrollment).
7.  **Bivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between two variables (e.g., `Status vs. Phases`, `Status vs. Study Type`).
8.  **Time Series Analysis:** Convert `Start Date` to datetime objects and plot the number of trials started per month and per year.
9.  **Advanced Insights:** Analyze the top sponsors and distribution of funding sources.
10. **Save Cleaned Data:** Export the fully cleaned DataFrame to `cleaned_covid_clinical_trials.csv`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **Python:** Core programming language.
  * **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
  * **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and plotting.
  * **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive code development and analysis.

## üìÅ Project Files

  * `Covid.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for the analysis.
  * `COVID clinical trials.csv`: The original, raw dataset (not included in this summary, but assumed to be in the repo).
  * `cleaned_covid_clinical_trials.csv`: The cleaned dataset exported from the notebook, ready for further use.
  * `*.png`: All 16 visualization plots generated by the notebook.

## üí° How to Run This Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
    ```

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Covid.ipynb
    ```

4.  **Explore:** Run the cells in the notebook sequentially. All visualizations and the cleaned CSV file will be generated in the root directory.

## üîÆ Future Work

The "Next Steps" suggested by the analysis include:

1.  **Machine Learning:** Use the `cleaned_covid_clinical_trials.csv` dataset to build predictive models (e.g., predicting trial status or enrollment numbers).
2.  **Deeper Analysis:** Perform a more in-depth analysis of `Interventions`, `Outcome Measures`, and `Conditions`.
3.  **NLP:** Apply Natural Language Processing to the `Title` and `Outcome Measures` columns to extract common themes and research topics.
